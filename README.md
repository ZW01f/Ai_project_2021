# pogram Details

- After Holding the PDF file by browsing form, The program passes it to [**PDFID**](https://github.com/ZW01f/Ai_project_2021/blob/main/important_files/pdfid.py) script then calls the **Feature-extract** function to extract and reformat features to an array .
- next, we give that array to [**AI-Modul**](https://github.com/ZW01f/Ai_project_2021/blob/main/MachineLearningModel/Malicious_Detection.ipynb) to analyze the file
- lastly, print the status that if the file is **clean** or **malicious**.

# Data set

- All files we used is owned by **Mila parkour**, and you can download it from [contagiodump](http://contagiodump.blogspot.com/2013/03/16800-clean-and-11960-malicious-files.html) .
    
- Extracted data in **dataset.csv** based on [**pdfid**](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/Pdfid) and you can find the complete script in the repository.
